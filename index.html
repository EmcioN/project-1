      Warzone2.0, part of the Callofduty: Modern Warface 2 online game
      released in 2022, is full of tips and tricks that can make you a top player on the
      field. Learning how to effectively utilize cover, keep an eye on your radar,
      use Warzone's loadout system and move quickly will help ensure success. 
      It is also important to be aware of your surroundings and pick up special weapons 
      like juggernaut suits and perks such as increased health regeneration or higher accuracy 
      with specific guns. Utilizing quick strategies like finding good hiding spots or setting 
      traps for opponents helps in dominating the Warzone2.0 battlefield, while being able to 
      recognize sound cues like incoming airstrikes or reinforcements can also give players an edge
      over their opponents. So if you are looking to become a Warzone2.0 master, 
      learning these essential tips and tricks will prepare you for battle!

          <h2>Landing spot <i class="fas fa-map-marked-alt"></i></h2>
           <p>
           The best Warzone 2 landing spot will depend on what kind of strategy you're looking
           to employ, whether it be aggressive or defensive. There are some areas in Warzone 2 
           that tend to be better spots than others though, such as Zaya Observatory, Al Mazrah 
           City, Ahkdar Village, Zarqwa Hydroelectric.
          </p>  
         </li>
         <li>
          <h2>Pop and cut <i class="far fa-hand-scissors"></i></h2>
           <p>
           Warzone2.0 offers players plenty of ways to customize their experience and one of 
           those is the ability to “pop and cut” their chute to drop more quickly. 
           When a player pops their chute, it helps them avoid getting killed too close to the 
           ground when they deploy from the plane. After that, at any point in the descent, 
           they can then quickly cut the chute so they descend faster, although with greater 
           risk of taking damage. Knowing when to pop and cut is essential for Warzone2.0 players 
           looking make an impact on the battlefield as soon as possible!
          </p>
         </li>
         <li>
          <h2>Pick up everything <i class="fas fa-box-open"></i></h2>
           <p>
           Warzone2.0 is highly replayable, thanks to the robust array of equipment available 
           throughout the map. If you want to get creative with your approach, why not deploy a 
           piece of cover or use Dead Silence field upgrade to make yourself quiet? These tools 
           can give you the tactical advantage that may just help you turn the tides in a fight. 
           Experimenting with Warzone2.0's various equipment options gives players an edge that 
           can make a huge difference in their end results - so get creative and have fun!
          </p>
         </li>
         <li>
          <h2>Pick up contracts <i class="fas fa-file-contract"></i></h2>
           <p>
           Warzone2.0 contracts are an essential part of your Warzone experience, as they give 
           you the opportunity to earn rewards such as cash and loot while also helping to 
           increase your K/D ratio. Bounties are a great way to test your combat skills and can 
           net you some useful items if you do them successfully, while Safecracker contracts 
           involve finding a Field Upgrade around the Warzone map. Secure Intel contracts have 
           you grabbing intel from enemy officers on the Warzone map and using it to your advantage. 
           Finally, Most Wanted contracts require you to defeat an enemy team leader and steal their 
           equipment, adding bonus loot to your inventory in return. With these various types of 
           contracts available in Warzone2.0, make sure you playthrough frequently so that you can 
           pick up contracts whenever possible and make the most out of Warzone2.0!
           </p>
         </li>
         <li>
          <h2>Communication is key <i class="fas fa-comments"></i></h2>
           <p>
           Warzone 2.0 is no exception when it comes to modern battle royale game's, as it also 
           includes a handy ping system to offer some effective communication between squad mates. 
           Its use is easy and highly encouranged; all you need to do is map it onto a single 
           button and viola - use the ping system whenever you can! Your comrades will be grateful 
           for every bit of information, so share often and help make your squad excel in 
           Warzone 2.0.
           </p>
         </li>
         <li>
          <h2>Spend your money <i class="fas fa-money-bill-alt"></i></h2>
           <p>
           Warzone 2.0 has a cash economy at its heart, where players can collect money as they 
           play and even earn more by completing in-game contracts. Instead of hoarding the cash 
           however, it is best used at Buy Stations which are marked on your map. These allow 
           players to purchase killstreaks such as Precision Airtsrikes or Mortar Strikes, 
           weapons, and armor plating for a better chance of success in battleRoyale. My advice 
           to not keep the cash too long since it cannot be taken with you, but instead use it 
           proactively to purchase useful rewards that can boost your chances in the Warzone 2.0 
           world.
           </p>
         </li>
         <li>
          <h2>Get your loadout <i class="fas fa-parachute-box"></i></h2>
           <p>
           Warzone 2.0 has definitely made a name for itself as one of the most challenging battle 
           royales out there. When playing Warzone, having cash is important, but it's worth 
           knowing what priority to set when hitting up a buy station. Killstreaks can be 
           incredibly helpful, but one should make kitting yourself out with primary weapons 
           your top priority. These are custom guns that you can buy once at a time, and lots of 
           experienced Warzone players use this method to dominate their opponents. 
           It's definitely worth following suit if possible! Loadout drops have been re-introduced 
           to Warzone, however they cost an expensive $8,000 per player in your squad, so unless 
           you absolutely need them, it might not be worth the splurge each time. You can also get 
           your loadout through an airdrop depending on your luck. Knowing what to prioritize when 
           playing Warzone 2.0 will ultimately be key in gaining that Warzone victory you've been 
           working towards!
           </p>
         </li>
         <li>
          <h2>Setting <i class="fas fa-cogs"></i></h2>
           <p>
           Warzone 2.0 has some great features that allow you to customize the settings to fit 
           your playing style. Whether you're on a PC or console, tweaking your settings can help 
           you get better results in Warzone 2.0. Make sure the controller or mouse sensitivity 
           feels good for you and turn on an ADS multiplier - this feature adjusts the sensitivity 
           depending on how zoomed in you are with your weapon's sites. Turning off all in-game 
           music is another suggestion as it can be disruptive and obstruct important audio like 
           footsteps during endgame circles, allowing for total focus and possibly a better outcome.
           </p>
         </li>         
         <li>
          <h2>Play as a team <i class="fas fa-users"></i></h2>
           <p>
           Warzone2.0 is more fun when teams work together and keep an eye out for their squadmates. 
           We encourage grouping up, using strategy, and utilizing everyone’s resources. If you have 
           full armor, but can spare a few plates for your team, don’t hesitate to drop them so that 
           others can pick them up. Working together means improved chances of survival for all. So 
           never forget: share your resources with the ones around you!
           </p>
         </li>  
         <li>
          <h2>Don't leave when you die <i class="fas fa-skull-crossbones"></i></h2>
           <p>
           Warzone2.0 has revolutionized the idea of death in battle - if you die, it's not the end 
           of the game. As long as you didn't die right at the end, when you are killed, you will 
           be sent to the Gulag, a unique prison situated underground. In this mineshaft you will 
           have time to prepare for an intense two-on-two gunfight with victors earning their 
           returned entry onto the battlefield. If your team is particularly generous and lucky 
           enough to have enough money, they can even pay for your return ticket back onto 
           Warzone2.0! Exploit this unique Warzone feature by perfecting your combat skills 
           in the Gulag and take those newfound strategies into battle!
           </p>
         </li>
         <li>
          <h2>Be aware <i class="fas fa-exclamation"></i></h2>
           <p>
           Warzone 2.0's Battle Royale mode has a feature that players should be aware 
           of - the signal flare. Whether you're starting to broadcast at an Intel contract 
           point or buying back a squadmate, make sure to keep an eye out for any flares in 
           the sky. Starting to broadcast sends up a white flare, while buying back a squadmate 
           shows up as a red one - both visible to anyone looking in their vicinity. Being aware 
           of these flares can give you an edge against your opponents, so it's important to 
           watch out for them at all times!
           </p>
         </li>
         <li>
          <h2>Don't be afraid <i class="fas fa-biohazard"></i></h2>
           <p>
           Warzone2.0 has become a popular way to test your tactical prowess in the heat of battle. 
           One powerful tactic is hugging the outside of the gas ring as it closes, allowing you to 
           pick off any fleeing targets and take out an opponent team with ease. To do this 
           effectively however, a gas mask is needed – and while the mask's animation issues are 
           slowly being resolved, you better make sure you're aware of them before entering the 
           endgame! Warzone2.0 has made remaining alive until the end a viable strategy – just make 
           sure that that gas mask doesn't lead to your own doom.
           </p>
         </li>
         <li>
          <h2>Events <i class="fas fa-thermometer-full"></i></h2>
           <p>
           Warzone 2.0 had removed many of the unique in-match events that Warzone 1.0 had, which 
           undoubtedly left players with an overall disappointing experience. Though there are 
           still a few events that players can look out for during the Warzone matches, they seem 
           to pale in comparison to those available before. Players should be cautious and try not 
           to get too comfortable with their strategies as any one of these occurring could 
           completely change the tone of the match - whether it is Nuclear Attack or supplies 
           dropping from a Warbird flyover, it always brings excitement and challenge as opponents 
           must strategize fast if they want to win the Warzone match.
           </p>
         </li>
         <li>
          <h2>Beyond limits <i class="fas fa-hand-point-up"></i></h2> 
           <p>        
           Warzone2.0 has opened up a world of possibility for gamers, allowing them to make use of 
           larger backpacks and unrestricted item selection. This means players are able to store a 
           variety of equipment without having to worry about the restrictions from Warzone1 - you 
           can easily fit 12-15 armour plates, multiple Self Revive packs, several Gas Masks and 
           even a 3rd weapon into your pack. Warzone2.0 also provides an extra level of immersion 
           as you can make use of the environment around you - scavenge around abandoned buildings 
           and containers to find the items that could help turn the tide in battle!
